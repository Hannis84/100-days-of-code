# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 26, Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Registered to FreeCodeCamp. Finished 'HTML5 and CSS' and 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap'

**Thoughts**: As I already have quite a lot of experience in coding, this seemed a way too easy. For some reason I still like to do these really easy things occasionally. Tomorrow I probably should code something much more challenging in order to deepen my coding skills.

### Day 1: February 27, Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked with my React project. React Modal to Redux and imported some more graphics to my project. Modified React modal to work as as settings dropdown menu, as it seemed to fit the purpose.

**Thoughts**: It was surprisingly easy to work in the train. Got about 30 minutes of good working time both in the morning and on the way home. Maybe I should start doing this every day?
