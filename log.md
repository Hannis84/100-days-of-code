# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 26, Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Registered to FreeCodeCamp. Finished 'HTML5 and CSS' and 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap'

**Thoughts**: As I already have quite a lot of experience in coding, this seemed a way too easy. For some reason I still like to do these really easy things occasionally. Tomorrow I probably should code something much more challenging in order to deepen my coding skills.
